## Public Notes

- T02: Domain evidence is in `/status` (`domain.connected`, assigned domain, A-record target) and `domain.config.json`. Verify HTTPS domain, plain HTTP domain/IP compatibility at `http://20.114.32.177`. No DNS portal credentials are committed.

List anything judges should know without exposing credentials or private infrastructure details.
